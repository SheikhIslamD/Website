Project Experience

 Do or Die | Third person platforming game: https://github.com/SheikhIslamD/Do_or_Die
For this game, I contributed to several scripts for essential game features
-Wrote the DiceProjectile script for the character's main dice head-toss ability, 
-Created the AudioManager setup for adding sounds to the game, 
-Implemented a ScoreTracker to allow the player to carry a score for winning, 
-PauseScript to implement a pausing function that is used for ending and win states too, 
-Partial contributions to things like LockIn for the lockon ability, PearlyGates for a level bugfix, and PlayerMovement for HUD display variables.

 Line of Sight | Short horror game based on SCP: https://github.com/CBowneUCF/GP_P2G3_Hallway
I contributed more to the in-engine features of this project overall by designing and building the level and placing in assets, resulting in working minimally with scripts. I also mainly oversaw GitHub merges, pull requests, and related tasks.

 Knight-Out | 2D Brick-breaker game inspired by Breakout: https://github.com/SheikhIslamD/Classic-Game-Challenge
For this project I added pause functionality, player health displays, score tracking, audio implementation, and level switching through scripts. I also did some in-engine work like placing UI elements that were tied to the corresponding scripts.
